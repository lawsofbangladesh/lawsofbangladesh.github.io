*The Evidence Act, 1872 is one of the most important pieces of legislation in the Indian subcontinent's legal system. It comprehensively deals with what evidence is admissible in courts, how facts should be proved, and the procedures for examination of witnesses. This Act continues to be the foundational law for evidence in Bangladesh's legal system.*
