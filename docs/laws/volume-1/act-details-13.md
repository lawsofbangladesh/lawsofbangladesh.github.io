- The name of the place at which such carriage is licensed

### Section 5 - Charge for and Duration of License

## Requirements and Penalties

## Administrative Provisions

### Section 11 - Revocation of License
Any Magistrate within the local limits of whose jurisdiction any stage-carriage shall ply, or who has granted the license of any stage-carriage may cancel the license of such stage-carriage if it appears to him that such stage-carriage or any horse or any harness used with such carriage is unserviceable or unsafe or otherwise unfit for public accommodation or use.

## Historical Context

This Act was enacted to regulate the stage-carriage transportation system during the British colonial period, establishing licensing requirements and safety standards for passenger transportation.

## Current Application

This Act continues to provide the legal framework for regulating certain aspects of passenger transportation in Bangladesh, though modern transportation laws have largely superseded many of its provisions.
