# THE [***] REVENUE COMMISSIONERS REGULATION, 1829

**(BENGAL REGULATION I OF 1829)**

**Published:** [ 1th January, 1829 ]

---

## Description

*A Regulation for constituting Commissioners of Revenue and Circuit*

---

## Preamble

**1.** The system in operation for superintending the magistracy and the police, and for controlling and directing the executive Revenue-officers [***] has been found to be defective.

The Courts of Appeal and Circuit, as now constituted, partly from the extent of country placed under their authority, and partly from their having to discharge the duties of both civil and criminal tribunals, have, in Many cases, failed to afford that prompt administration of justice which it is the duty of the Government to secure for the people.

The goal-deliveries have been, in some instances, delayed beyond the term prescribed by law, and a great arrear of cases under appeal has accrued in all the Courts, to the manifest injury of many individuals and to the encouragement of litigation and crime.

The Judges of Circuit, when employed singly in the districts under their authority, do not possess sufficient powers, nor have they the opportunity of acquiring sufficient local knowledge, to enable them adequately to control the police or protect the people.

[***]

[For the correction of the above defects, it has appeared to be expedient and necessary to place the magistracy and police under the superintendence and control of Commissioners, each vested with the charge of such a moderate tract of country as may enable them to be easy of access to the people, and frequently to visit the different parts of their respective jurisdictions]

With the above views and purposes the [Government] has enacted the following rules to be in force from the 1st March, 1829, throughout the Country.
