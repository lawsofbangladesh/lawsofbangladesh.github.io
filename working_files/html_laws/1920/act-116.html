A person pleading ignorance of the issue of the notice under that sub-section shall not be made a party to the reference unless he proves to the satisfaction of the said Court that he had no knowledge that the land had been attached. The said Court shall also determine which of the claimants has the right to begin at the hearing of the reference.<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>	(3) Save as otherwise provided in this Act, a reference made under sub-section (1), shall be deemed to be a suit for all the purposes of the <a title='Code of Civil Procedure, 1908' href='/act-86.html'>Code of Civil Procedure, 1908</a>, and every decision by a Civil Court under sub-section (2), shall be deemed to be a decree within the meaning of that Code and appealable as such.<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>	(4) The said Court shall decide to whom and in what proportions the net receipts, if any, from the land during attachment shall be paid. The net receipts shall be calculated by deducting from the gross receipts the costs incurred under section 3, section 4, sub-section (1), section 4A, sub-section (1), and the costs incurred by the Collector in the proceedings under this section including the cost of preparation of the reference made under sub-section (1).<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>	(5)	The said Court shall also decide by whom and in what proportions the costs incurred under section 3, section 4, sub-section (1), section 4A, sub-section (1), and the costs incurred by the Collector and by the other parties in the proceedings under this section including the cost of preparation of the reference made under sub-section (1), are payable.<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>	(6) 	If the costs referred to in sub-section (4) exceed the gross receipts the Court shall decide by whom and in what proportions the amount of such excess shall be payable, and such amount shall be recoverable by the Collector, in accordance with the decision of the Court, from the persons liable, as arrears of a public demand.<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>	(7) 	The person entitled to the net receipts may apply to the Court for the recovery from the persons liable of any amount deducted from the gross receipts in excess of the amount, so deducted, for which he is himself liable. If Government are entitle to the net receipts or to any part thereof the Collector may recover as arrears of a public demand any amount due to Government or may apply to the Court for the recovery of the same.<div class="clbr">&nbsp;</div><div class="na">&nbsp;</div>	(8) 	A reference made under sub-section (1) shall not be dismissed for default but the said Court shall decide the same after taking the evidence of such of the claimants mentioned by the Collector in the order of reference or added by the Court under section 5, sub-section (2), as it may think necessary.
